# Device Location Service
This project is designed to handle and process GPS location data generated by IoT devices. The system receives data over TCP, processes it through a queue, and stores it in a database. It provides a GraphQL API for managing devices and querying location data. The application is fully dockerized for easy deployment and scalability.
